        <h1>Designing a game that lets you experience OV during a global pandemic</h1>

        <div class="project1-p">
            <div class="start">
                <p>Due to health concerns regarding COVID-19, we're in the midst of experiencing a new lifestyle that made a significant impact on our daily lives. But we're also experiencing difficulties at work where people behave differently around others whether by physically or verbally. This is identified as Occupational violence or for short OV. OV may be described as any incident where an employee is abused, threatened, or assaulted by a member of the public in circumstances related to their work.
                    In response to this problem, my team consisting of six RMIT university students decided to solve this problem and designed Through Other Eyes, a public awareness campaign game targeting the general public to experience OV to tackle their lack of awareness.</p>
